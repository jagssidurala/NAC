															NAC – NASSCOM ASSESSMENT OF COMPETENCE</strong></span><br>
													<br>
													The ITeS-BPO industry is growing at an overwhelming pace and giving a major 
													fillip to the Indian economy. India has established its leadership position 
													globally in the offshoring market and now the availability of skilled manpower 
													is one of the key barriers to the fast growth of the industry.NASSCOM along 
													with program manager, has been working with the Indian ITeS-BPO industry 
													players to create a national assessment and certification program - the NASSCOM 
													Assessment of Competence (NAC). The initiative is aimed at creating a robust 
													and continuous pipeline of talent. This will be done by continuously assessing 
													candidates on key skills through a national standard assessment, thus making it 
													easier for firms to screen candidates and also provide training need analysis 
													to candidates. This will then be tied in to training and development efforts to 
													help more candidates become competent to work in the industry. NASSCOM is 
													following a multi-pronged approach to facilitate manpower development for the 
													short and long term. By following a two-phase strategy, NASSCOM is aiming to 
													build a pool of ITeS-BPO manpower which will be pre-certified, in tune with the 
													needs of the industry and thereby gear up for the future requirements of the 
													sector. In Phase I of this initiative, NASSCOM is looking at creating an 
													Assessment and Certification Program which becomes an industry standard and 
													ensures the transformation of a "trainable" workforce into an "employable" 
													workforce.

															OF NAC</strong></span><br>
													<br>
													In-depth meetings with close to 35 players in the ITeS-BPO industry were 
													conducted to understand their recruitment practices, cause of attrition desired 
													skills in a candidate, etc. Based on this, a job-skill matrix was developed 
													which formed the basis for the design of this assessment program. Core and 
													Working Committees from the industry were formed and constant interactions were 
													made to make sure that the program has everything that the industry requires in 
													terms of a pre-employment assessment. An evaluation committee was set up to 
													finalize the vendors and decide on the approach to the pilot.Multi-tier 
													evaluation of the vendors happened after the initial interaction. The 
													identified vendors provided the content and technology to run the test. Amongst 
													the current endorsers for NAC are companies like Genpact, Accenture, Convergys, 
													IBM, WNS &amp; EXL. Discussions have been initiated by NASSCOM with other 
													companies as well to get more endorsements.

															ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)</strong></span><br>
													<ul>
														<li>
															<strong align="justify">Where does Indian BPO industry stand today?</strong><br>
															Indian BPO sector continues to grow from strength to strength, witnessing high 
															levels of activity - both onshore as well as offshore. The industry clocked 
															export revenue of US$ 12.7 billion in FY2008-09 registering about 18% growth 
															from FY2007-08. The BPO sector also created 86,000 jobs in FY08-09 adding the 
															total employment to around 7,86,000 in the same period. According to various 
															research agencies, the BPO sector is poised to register an even handed growth 
															rate and is expected to generate 6 times more employment in next 12 years.<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>What role do BPO companies play in NAC?</strong><br>
															This initiative will always be driven by the 'need of the BPO industry' when it 
															comes to the human talent / skills required for different types of jobs that 
															the industry offers, hence BPO companies are bound to play a vital role here. 
															During the conceptualization of NAC, the BPO majors that helped devise the NAC 
															program are Genpact, Accenture, Convergys, IBM, WNS &amp; EXL.<br>
															<br>
															Discussions have been initiated by NASSCOM with other BPO companies to get more 
															endorsements.<br>
															<br>
															During the current phase and the times to come, industry will play a more 
															crucial role in lending credibility / endorsement to the NAC and will help 
															ensuring that this program gets differentiated amongst other similar products 
															which are available in the market. Companies would support the program by 
															various means and ensure that, over a period of time, NAC is mandated to be the 
															first-level filter while they hire for entry-level positions.<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>What are the skills being assessed in NAC?</strong><br>
															Please see "NAC Test Matrix" section above<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>What is the minimum educational qualification / eligibility required to 
																participate in the program?</strong><br>
															Final-Year Undergraduate (according to the '10+2+3' system) – all 'General' 
															streams<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>Are there any training programs / courses that one needs to attend before 
																attempting NAC?</strong><br>
															Since NAC encapsulates skills which are extremely basic in nature, NASSCOM does 
															not endorse/recommend any Training or Training Company for the preparation of 
															NAC. However, there are very many training programs, specific to BPO skills, 
															which are available across the country that may be attended if found convincing 
															by the candidate.<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>How to participate in the program and take the test?</strong><br>
															Currently, one can take the test only if:
															<ul type="circle">
																<li>
																A state is holding the test and is inviting candidates for it
																<li>
																	A college/university/institute is holding the test for its own students
																</li>
															</ul>
															<br>
															In the current scenario, one cannot take the test as an individual; however, 
															necessary work is underway in order to have the 'retail drives' in place, where 
															individual candidates will be able to register 'as an individual' and take the 
															test. The 'retail model' is anticipated to be in place by Mar / Apr 2011.
															<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>Does one need to pay for this program?</strong><br>
															Under the two currently-running models/approaches (as mentioned above) may/may 
															not require the candidate to pay for the test as this is completely at the 
															discretion of the client organizing for the test (e.g. state / college / 
															university / institute). However, once the retail model is launched, candidates 
															will essentially have to pay the test fee.<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>Will people have access to NAC from small / tier-II, III cities?</strong><br>
															'Retail model' will surely cater to small towns/cities. However, currently, 
															with the two above-stated approaches, these towns/cities can still be served by 
															the organizing bodies (i.e. state / college / university / institute).<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>What is the progress on NAC initiative?</strong><br>
															In pilot phase, NAC was conducted in 14 states across India and also with few 
															individual colleges/universities with about 20,000+ candidates appearing for 
															it.
															<br>
															<br>
															To take this forward, multiple approaches will be looked into to cover the 
															country, schedules regarding which, will be published on the NAC website 
															time-to-time and shall also be made known to the public through various media 
															sources.<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>Who will own this program going forward?</strong><br>
															NASSCOM, on behalf of the industry, will continue to play the central role. 
															However, the business &amp; governing model of this program, in view of long 
															term, is under consideration.<br>
															<br>
														<li>
															<strong>Whom should we contact at NASSCOM for further details?</strong><br>
															For further details on NAC, please contact Dr. Sandhya Chintala, Senior 
															Director (Education Initiatives) / Mr. Nikhil Gupta, Manager (Education 
															Initiatives) at <a href="mailto:nac@nasscom.in" class="small_blue">nac@nasscom.in</a><br>
