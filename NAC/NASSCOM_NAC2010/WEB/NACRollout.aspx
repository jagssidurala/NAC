															multiple states in India. In 15-18 months, the NAC is expected to be 
															administered on a fix calendar basis 4-6 times a year; with multiple states 
															signing on for any of the above dates. The NAC pilot testing started on August 
															20, 2005. Before launching NAC, NASSCOM and industry players judged the success 
															of pilot based on following criteria:</p>

														&nbsp;</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td class="fontNormal">
														<ul>
															<li>
															NAC’s alignment to sourcing requirement
															<li>
															Feedback on the ability of participating vendors to deliver
															<li>
															Validity post training
															<li>
																Impact on job performance
															</li>
														</ul>
													</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>
														<p class="fontNormal">After the successful completion of pilot, NASSCOM began the 
															process of National roll-out of NAC, which started from the state of Rajasthan. 
															The first NAC administration under this roll-out took place at Jaipur and Ajmer 
															on 18th November 2006. NAC received an overwhelming response and over 2500 
															candidates were tested on that day.<br>
															<br>
															<b>Rajasthan NAC Job Fair</b><br>
															On 31st March 07–01st April 07, a job fair was conducted at Jaipur for 
															candidates who took NAC test in the month of November 2006 at Rajasthan. This 
															was a step further beyond the assessment platform that was provided to the job 
															aspirants in that region.<br>
															<br>
															Eleven of the top ITES-BPO companies participated in the job fair and some of 
															them even made offers to the candidates on the spot, which basically talks 
															about the success of NAC. A complete analysis will be carried out on this 
															exercise and learning will be incorporated in further similar exercises to 
															churn out better results.<br>
															Next states to join the bandwagon are Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, 
															Tamil Nadu, etc. Gradually, over a year’s period, NAC should spread across 
															25-30 cities in India.<br>
															<br>
															For further details on NAC, please contact Dr. Sandhya Chintala, Director 
															(Education Initiatives) / Mr. Nikhil Gupta, Manager (NAC Initiative) at <a href="mailto:nac@nasscom.in">
