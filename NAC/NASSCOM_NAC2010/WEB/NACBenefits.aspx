											The most recent benefit, introduced by NASSCOM, is in association with Timesjobs.Com (India’s leading job portal). Through this, NASSCOM has stepped into an agreement with Timesjobs.Com, where Timesjobs.Com has developed a ‘customized resume form’ for all NAC candidates, where they can create their resume on the Times portal and can also get their NAC scores attached to it. This helps the test takers to showcase their potential to the recruiters across different skills / competencies in a quantitative & a qualitative manner, that too without appearing for the interview. The resume (along with the NAC scores) of each such candidate is seen by thousands of recruiters who, by looking at the NAC scores, get instant clarity on candidate’s capability and hence can do quick shortlisting.</p>

											<b>Universities / Colleges / Training Institutes</b>
											<br>
											A robust training backend framework is necessarily required to make any assessment successful, which holds true for NAC as well. Different education bodies can work to align the curriculum to the changing industry trends on the basis of this assessment. Through NAC, they would be able to identify specific training needs of their students so that training modules could be designed for them in light of their NAC performance.
