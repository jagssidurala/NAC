														<p class="textNormal">The Indian BPO industry is growing at an overwhelming pace 
															giving a major boost to the Indian economy. India has established its 
															leadership position globally in the outsourcing market and now the availability 
															of skilled manpower is one of the key barriers to the fast growth of the 
															industry.
														</p>
														<p class="textNormal">NASSCOM, with the support from the Indian BPO industry 
															partners, has devised an assessment-cum-certification program - the NASSCOM 
															Assessment of Competence (NAC). The initiative is aimed at creating a robust 
															and continuous pipeline of talent that is suitable for the BPO jobs. This will 
															be done by continuously assessing candidates on key skills through NAC, thus 
															making it easier for firms to screen candidates and also provide them with 
															training-need analysis. This shall further be tied in to training and 
															development efforts by different stakeholders to help more candidates become 
															competent to work in the industry. NASSCOM eventually aims to build a pool of 
															potential candidates, which will be pre-certified (i.e. through NAC), in tune 
															with the needs of the industry and thereby gear up for the future requirements 
															of the sector.

														<p class="textNormal">In the year 2005, in-depth meetings with close to 35 Indian 
															BPO companies were conducted to understand their recruitment practices, cause 
															of attrition, desired skills in a candidate, etc. Based on this, a job-skill 
															matrix was developed which formed the basis for designing of the NAC 
															assessment. Committees from the industry were formed to ensure that the program 
															has everything that the industry requires in terms of a pre-employment 
															assessment. Thereafter, the ‘NAC pilot phase-I’ was kicked-off where RFQ 
															(Request For Quote) was sent to about 19 vendors and 11 of them qualified for 
															next level evaluation. After a round of detailed presentations and 
															comprehensive evaluation, 4 vendors were chosen, with whom the pilot was 
															initiated. The objective of pilot was to understand the industry 
															benchmarks/thresholds vis-à-vis the skills required by companies and also to 
															identify the worth of each of the final vendors, who could be used for the 
															‘National Rollout’ of the NAC program. These vendors provided the content and 
															technology to run the pilot. Selected companies from the industry, identified 
															by NASSCOM, partnered in deployment of the pilot program. The locations for the 
															first stage of pilot were identified as Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore and 
															Chennai and about 6,000 assessments were conducted during the pilot.</p>

															In the next phase of NAC, NASSCOM has been conducting NAC with different State 
															Governments, identified deemed Universities / Colleges in various states, etc. 
															The target audience is final-year students (from all ‘general’ streams) who 
															will be venturing into the job market after few months. The intent behind 
															assessing these students is to analyze the level of talent which is available 
															in various parts of country, especially in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Gauging 
															this would eventually help identify regions in India where the readily 
															available BPO-fit talent exists; also identify the community that requires 
															training before joining the industry. These test takers are further provided an 
															opportunity to connect to various companies where they can showcase their NAC 
															scores which obviously helps a company identify the potential candidate.</p>

														In addition to the above, NAC will be an open standard and other industries will be welcomed to use the same for their talent benchmarking and recruitment. NASSCOM is open to explore the opportunity of rolling out NAC like assessment in locations beyond India, if the same fits in well with NASSCOM’s members and they demand the same.
